# Schwarzchild-Black-Hole-Solution
Einstein field equation solution for sperically symmetric object kept in vaccume using Mathematica.

Background: We will start with a static and spherically symmetric metric. Only gtt, grr, gthetha-thetha, gphi-phi terms survives. Out of which gthetha-thetha and gphi-phi are -r^2 and -r^2Sin^2(thetha), this is because for a t=constant and r=constant surface the object must have a line element of a two-sphere. So what left is to calculate gtt and grr. will call gtt and grr terms to be A(r) and B(r) respectively. As the object is kept in vaccume, we will have T_mu-nu to be zero, this gives R_mu-nu to be zero. In general R_mu-nu is has 10 components as it is a symmetric tensor, but because of symmetries we invoked in the line element we will see that only the digonal terms are non-zero. All the non-diagonal terms will vanishs.

Procedure: We start calculating Affine connection, Riemann tensor, and Ricci tensor. We will then set the components of Ricci tensor to be zero, this will result four equations. We will see that the fourth equation is a dependent equation. We will solve the three equations and invoke some conditions such as the space is asymptotically flat and the gtt component must give Newton-gravity in weak field limit.

Thus by solving three equations and invoking conditions such as space is asymptotically flat and gtt component must give Newton-gravity in weak field limit, we calcuate the line element.
